**LitWorld2D** - simple 2d physics engine in 300 lines of code. It has following features implemented:
- Particles
- Boxes
- Spring joints
- "Inflated" bodies

This physics engine doesn't support impulse accumulation or warm-starting or any other "smart" techniques. 
So it is not very stable and sometimes can't converge. It is done for tutorials.

### Dependencies
- glm
- glew
- SDL2
